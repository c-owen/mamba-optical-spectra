# Mamba Optical Spectra Classification

This project uses Mamba (selective state space models) to classify synthetic optical spectra into different physical regimes such as stable single-mode, mode hopping, clipped spectra, and high-noise scenarios.

## Repo Structure
See `src/`, `notebooks/`, and `reports/` directories for code, experiments, and report drafts.

## Setup
